== Workflow Example

=== Compose

A configuration is specified in JSON format. A sample configuration for the _Skeleton_ module is shown below.

The configuration section for a single module without any input pin, that means, without any preceding module would be rather short. It would only contain the first few lines up until the `chain` property being an empty array. Such a module is often called a source or adapter module, enabling _Connected Vision_ to retrieve data from any source (e.g. file system, YouTube, etc.). The actual source of the data is provided via the parameters of the configuration. It is also possible that the module is generating the data purely out of its configuration (e.g. the _SyntheticVideo_ or _DummyBoundingBoxes_ modules in the example below). On the one hand, these modules are very helpful for testing and development purposes. On the other hand, they are not very interesting from an educational point of view. This is due to the fact that they are not a good example for demonstrating a module workflow and/or development. They simply lack half of the functionality of a "normal" _Connected Vision_ module.

For demonstration purposes, the _Skeleton_ module is used. It has two input pins, one output pin and implements a simple algorithm. While the functionality of the _Skeleton_ module is very basic, it uses the whole spectrum of the _Connected Vision_ API and the algorithm is simple enough to not distract from the generic API usage.

Since the _Skeleton_ module has two input pins consuming data from two different preceding modules, the `chain` property extends to the length of the sample configuration shown below. The preceding modules which provide the input data are the _SyntheticVideo_ module and the _DummyBoundingBoxes_ module. Both modules have a configuration of their own and their output pins are connected to the designated input pins of the _Skeleton_ module.

The `chain` property is an array of chain objects. Each chain object needs to have two properties `connections` and `config`. The `connections` array contains connection objects with two properties: `inputPinID` is the name of the current module's input pin connected to the output pin of the preceding module identified by its `outputPinID`. In the sample config the name of the `inputPinID` and `outputPinID` pins are the same but this is not a requirement. It is required though, that the MIME type of the input- and output pin match. For metadata pins the properties of the input pin have to be at least a subset of the output pin properties.

=== Submit

Once the configuration is composed, it has to be provided to the server using an HTTP <<POST /Skeleton/0/config,POST>> request. Upon success, the configuration is returned with some of its properties such as the configuration ID being automatically populated. Submitting a configuration which already exists on the server has no effect.

=== Reset

A configuration can be resetted using the <<GET /Skeleton/{configId}/control/reset,reset >> request. Possibly existing results are deleted and upon the next start of the configuration it is executed as if it was just submitted to the server for the first time. 

WARNING: A reset also affects all predecessor modules used by this configuration and will delete the results of this modules as well. In order to reset only the current module but not its predecessors, the <<GET /Skeleton/{configId}/control/resetThis,resetThis>> request can be used.

=== Start

A configuration can be started using the <<GET /Skeleton/{configId}/control/start,start>> request. This command initiates the processing of the input data and subsequently provides results at the output pins. If connected predecessor modules are not already running (or finished) they will be started implicitly.


=== Status

The current status of a config can be check using the <<GET /Skeleton/{configId}/status,status>> request.

=== Results

The results of the _Skeleton_ module can be queried, once the config is started and computed at least a single result element. As mentioned in the <<_output,module structure output>> section, the result of the _Skeleton_ is simply a color value for each processed frame. Results can be queried by id, index or timestamp. For index and timestamp, also result ranges can be obtained. The various result request types can be found in the <<OutputPin, output pin>> section.
