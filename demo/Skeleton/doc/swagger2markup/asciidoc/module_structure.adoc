== Module Structure


=== Configuration

Depending on the module's task or purpose it may be necessary to conduct the same operation based on different parameter sets, using the same parameter set to process different input data or a combination of both. This is the point where configurations come into play. Each parameter set in combination with the input data source is represented by a unique configuration ID.
This configuration ID is used to control (start, stop, etc.) a configuration and also to query its results.

TIP: Synonymously you could use the words _"processing task"_ or _"batch job"_ instead of _"configuration"_, depending on how youâ€™d like to think about it.


==== Configuration ID

The configuration ID is automatically issued upon the submission of the configuration to the server. The ID is simply the hash of the configuration combined with the input data source specification. Changing any parameter or input source results in a new configuration (ID).
On the other hand, two independently created configurations using the same parameter set and input will result in the same configuration ID providing an inherent duplication protection and performance optimization.

TIP: If the same parameters on the same inputs (resulting in the same configuration) were submitted previously, all results that have been already computed are available instantly.


==== Parameters

The configuration parameters are specified as properties of the configuration's `params` sub-object. The available (and/or required) parameters of a module are specified in the module description as http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html[JSON Schema].

The parameters can be of the following types:

* boolean
* integer (signed integer 64-bit)
* number (double 64-bit)
* string
* any (binary object)
* array
* object


=== Input

A module can have an arbitrary number of inputs that are connected to outputs of other modules. 
The connection points of a module are called input pins and output pins, respectively. 
Each input pin is used to request either metadata or binary data. Metadata is structured in JSON format (MIME-Type: application/json). Binary data is required to conform to the specified https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml[MIME] type. If there is no appropriate MIME type for the data, a meaningful non-registered (e.g. application/x.my-type) MIME type can be used (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838#section-3.4[unregistered MIME]).

The _Skeleton_ module, for example, has two input pins:

* <<Skeleton_InputPin_Detections, Detections>>: bounding box specified in relative coordinates [0.0, 1.0] with respect to the image dimensions
* PNG-Image: image encoded as PNG


=== Output

Similarly to the <<Input,input>>, a module can have an arbitrary number of output pins. An output pin provides either metadata or binary data.

The _Skeleton_ module, for example, iterates all detections provided by the input pin, tries to query an image with a timestamp equal to or greater than the timestamp of the detection and conducts a computation on this data. In the case of the _Skeleton_ module the average color of the pixels within the bounding box is computed. The result of the operation is provided by the <<Skeleton_OutputPin_Average,Average>> metadata output pin. The output data comprises the average color specified by an RGB color triplet.
