==== Alias ID

The alias ID of a configuration an alternative method which is easier to remember for referencing hash-based configuration IDs. One configuration can have multiple alias IDs, and one alias ID can point to many configurations. In the second case, the latest configuration (timestamp of submission) will be referenced by the alias ID. 

WARNING: This means, that you might get two different configurations -- intendedly or unintendedly -- if you are using the same alias ID for two subsequent requests.
